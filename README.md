# BookScope

**BookScope** is a full-stack MERN application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorite reads to a personal collection. Originally built with RESTful APIs, this version has been refactored to use **GraphQL with Apollo Server**, providing a more flexible and performant way to manage and query data.

## Features

- Search books by title or keyword using the Google Books API
- View results with title, author, description, cover image, and link
- Create a user account and log in with JWT-based authentication
- Save and remove books from a personalized reading list
- View saved books on a separate dashboard
- Fully responsive and clean user interface
